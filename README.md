# Cody
Former IRC-bot, currently a Discord bot under development.

Cody is used primarily for ChatOps at KPM Transport AS.

This repo is not complete, and probably won't run if you try to download it. YAML config files containing passwords are on our gitignore, and play an important part in getting the bot to run.
